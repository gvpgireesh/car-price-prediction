ML model to predict used car prices using Random Forest
# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the resale price of used cars based on features like mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

## Dataset

- Features used:
  - Kms Driven
  - Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
  - Transmission (Manual/Automatic)
  - Seller Type
  - Owner Count
  - Car Age

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- RandomForestRegressor
- Streamlit (for web UI)
- joblib (for model serialization)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Install required packages:
3. Train the model using `car_price_model.py`.
4. Run the web app using:

## Project Outcome
- Predict car prices with good accuracy.
- Built interactive UI for non-technical users.
- Model saved as `car_price_model.pkl`.
