ML model to predict used car prices using Random Forest
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the resale price of used cars based on features like mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - CarDekho Vehicle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)
- Features used:
  - Kms Driven
  - Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
  - Transmission (Manual/Automatic)
  - Seller Type
  - Owner Count
  - Car Age

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
